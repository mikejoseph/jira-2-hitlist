jira-2-hitlist
================

Mostly a hacked-up version of [Jira-2-Omnifocus](https://github.com/prometheas/jira-2-omnifocus), so I really cannot take credit for this one.

I found it extremely helpful when triaging and tracking bug reports, and I figure the 2 other people that use both Jira and The Hit List might find this useful.

Adds a big "Send to The Hit List" button to the ticket detail view.

I am *in no way* afflilated with, nor is this endorsed by, Atlassian, Potion Factory, Karelia, or the [cat that made the original extension](https://github.com/prometheas).

### v1.0

- Initial public release
